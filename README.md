# ESP32 Web Server for IoT System Management



A web server solution built on the ESP32 platform to monitor and control IoT devices within a smart home or industrial IoT environment.​


## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Upload the code to your ESP32 using your preferred development environment (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO).​
3. Connect the ESP32 to your Wi-Fi network by configuring the secrets.h file with your SSID and password.​
4. Access the web interface by navigating to the ESP32's IP address in a web browser.​


## Prerequisites

- ESP32 development board
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- ESP32 board support package installed (e.g., for Esp32, Arduino esp32 Boards)
- Required modules (e.g., for potentiometer, LED)


## 📁 Project Structure

- src — Source code files for the ESP32 web server.
- data — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the web interface.
- docs — Documentation and system architecture diagrams.
